user1:Sweet Love:Boring movie.Just like every other romance drama.I went to sleep 2 or 3 times while watching it.My girlfriend too,and she was the one who wanted to watch it.Please never make another movie again.:2
user1:Star Wars:Phenomenal movie.Unbelievable graphics for its era.The plot kept me hanging until the last second.I sure hope the rest of the movies from the franchise are equally as good,if not better:5
user1:Forrest Gump:This movie made me cry so many times.Thrilling performance from Hanks.A beautiful lookback on late 20th century american history.10/10,would watch it many more times.Didnt even notice how 3 hours went by.:5
user1:Die Hard:THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE.2 HOURS FULL OF ACTION.AMAZING BRUCE WILLIS.I LOVED HIS CHARACTER.I WANT TO MARRY HIM.HANS GRUBER IS THE BEST VILLAIN IN THE HISTORY OF FICTION.THATS ALL.:5
user1:I Know What You Did Last Summer:Terrible movie.Bad pacing,awful jumpscares,really bad acting.Couldnt stand to watch the whole thing.Just a big disappointment all around.:1
user2:Supernatural:I want to have Jensen Ackles' children.The show is good too.My number 6980412329.:3
user2:Riverdale:Very entertaining mystery show.I loved season 1.Havent watched season 2 yet,but if they keep up the quality it will probably be a classic.I loved the teen drama part of it,and didnt find the dialogues cringe whatsoever.:4
user2:The End of the F***ing World:Exciting story,great acting,had me on the edge of my seat throughout.I would recommend this to a friend.:3
user1:Constantine:This is probably the best show I have watched in my entire life.I have no idea why it was cancelled.We need to petition to bring it back.It stops on a cliffhanger too!:4
